# No travel provisions

This is a simple mod for Crusader Kings 3 that removes the travel provisions that landless characters spend to move between provinces.

The game obviously isn't balanced around this, and this mod doesn't intend to address that. It's intended for people who want a more chill landless adventurer experience.
